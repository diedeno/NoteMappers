# NoteMappers
Pitch-transformation plugins for MuseScore music notation software

The primary mapping plugins  —  **Note to Note**, **Pc to Pc**, and **Pitch to Pitch** —  map pitches to new values using different models of pitch. The **Map Assistant** plugin lets you design various types of maps with music notation, using a specially formatted score. Maps (which are just comma-separated lists of numbers) can be copied from any of these sources and pasted as text in a score or text file to store them for future use.

Once copied, a map can be pasted into the appropriate mapping plugin, or into the **Adaptive Mapper**, which is designed to recognize and apply any valid map (five types in all). Finally, a **Pc Speller** utility is provided for customizing the spelling of each chromatic step; it is particularly useful in conjunction with the Pc to Pc and Pitch to Pitch plugins, which spell pitches according to built-in defaults that may not suit you.
